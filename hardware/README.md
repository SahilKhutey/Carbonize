# Hardware ↔ Software Cross-Reference Index

**Carbonize CBMS — Hardware Section Software Documents**  
**Last updated:** 2026-07-20

This document is the master index linking each hardware specification to its corresponding software specification. Every physical component in the CBMS pilot reactor has a software counterpart that handles data ingestion, lifecycle tracking, calibration management, and safety enforcement.

## Critical Path — Software Before Pilot Hardware Arrives

The following software items must be complete **before** the pilot reactor is switched on. Nothing else is blocked:

| Priority | Item | Spec Doc |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 P0 | `cbms-gateway` Python package + systemd service | daq-edge-cloud |
| 🔴 P0 | `ModbusDriver` + `RS232Driver` implementations | sensor-integration |
| 🔴 P0 | `POST /api/ingest/telemetry` endpoint | daq-edge-cloud |
| 🔴 P0 | Device JWT auth (`/api/auth/device`) | daq-edge-cloud |
| 🔴 P0 | InfluxDB Cloud bucket + write path | daq-edge-cloud |
| 🔴 P0 | `sensor_calibrations` Alembic migration | sensor-integration |
| 🔴 P0 | `reactor_components` + lifecycle Alembic migrations | lifecycle-tracking |
| 🔴 P1 | `QualityGuard` rule engine | sensor-integration |

## Sensor → Model Validation Dependency

The 5 sensors that gate model validation (per `sensor-stack.md` §"Critical Metrics"):

| Sensor | `sensor_id` | Validates | Software Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dissolved CO₂ | `CO2-DIS-01` | k_cat (CA activity) | `validation_data_quality = INSUFFICIENT` if GOOD < 5 min |
| Dissolved SO₂ | `SO2-DIS-01` | k_so2_abs | Same gate |
| Gas-phase CO₂ | `CO2-GAS-01` | Overall capture rate | Same gate (2 min timeout) |
| Turbidity | `TURB-LIQ-01` | CaCO₃ precipitation | Same gate (5 min timeout) |
| pH | `pH-LIQ-01` | Alkalinity budget | Same gate (10 min timeout) |

When any of these report `quality ≠ GOOD` for longer than the timeout, the simulation worker sets the run's `validation_data_quality = INSUFFICIENT` and the Sobol / UQ analysis is blocked from running — preventing false-precision results from bad sensor data.

## Cost Summary (Software Infrastructure)

| Layer | Component | Est. Monthly Cost (USD) |
|---|---|---|
| Edge | Raspberry Pi 5 + 4G SIM | $15–25/plant/month |
| Cloud | InfluxDB Cloud (Starter) | $0 up to 10K writes/s |
| Cloud | InfluxDB Cloud (Production, 50GB) | $~50/month |
| Cloud | PostgreSQL (Supabase / RDS t3.micro) | $~25/month |
| Cloud | Redis (Celery broker, ElastiCache t3.micro) | $~20/month |
| CDN | OTA update tarball hosting (S3) | $~1/month |
| **Total** | **Single-plant pilot** | **~$110/month** |

This is well within the operational budget modelled by the economic engine.
